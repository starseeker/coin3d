Coin is a 3D graphics library with an Application Programming Interface
based on the Open Inventor 2.1 API.  For those who are not familiar with
Open Inventor, it is a scene-graph based retain-mode rendering and model
interaction library, written in C++, which has become the de facto
standard graphics library for 3D visualization and visual simulation
software in the scientific and engineering community.
